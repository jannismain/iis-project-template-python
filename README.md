# Python Project Template

A customizable template for new Python projects to get you up and running with current best practices faster.

## Features

* Each project has a [README][] and [CHANGELOG][] file and includes further documentation based on [Material for MkDocs][] or [Sphinx][].
* [Testing][] and [continuous integration][ci] tooling are included from the very beginning
  * Test coverage is collected and displayed as a badge
  * Coverage report is integrated with [Gitlab's coverage report artifact][gitlab coverage report]
* Projects use [pre-commit][] to ensure adherence to a [coding style][] on the client side
* Projects use bumpversion to increase their version according to [semantic versioning guidelines][semver]
* Python projects are installable

Everything comes pre-configured with sensible defaults so you can focus on your implementation and let the template handle the rest.

See this [sample project](https://github.com/jannismain/python-project-template-example) to see how projects generated from this template using default values look like.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* [copier](https://github.com/copier-org/copier)

*Note: If you have [`pipx`][pipx] installed (you should, it is good), you can simply use `pipx run copier` out of the box.*

### Usage

```console
copier copy --trust https://github.com/jannismain/python-project-template my_new_project
```

*Note: `--trust` is required because the template uses [tasks][] to setup your git repository for you.*

### Next Steps

#### Configure Remote Repository

During the project creation, you will be asked about the Gitlab remote url where your project will be pushed to. You can take that moment to create a new project in Gitlab and copy its link into the questionnaire. You can also change this value later by modifying the git remote associated with your project

```sh
git config remote.origin.url <url_to_project>
```

If your remote repository is created and configured, you can create an initial commit and push it to your remote

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
git push -u origin main
```

**Note**: Depending on which *default_branch* you configured, you might need to replace `main` with the name of your default branch.

#### Install Project

The new project is installable right away. Create a virtual environment using any method you like, for example using the builtin `venv` module:

```sh
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Now you can use `make install-dev`, to install your Python project in-place with all optional dev requirements.

#### Start Implementing

Now you are ready to start your implementation. As a quick reference, Python packages and modules go into `./src/`, documentation into `./docs/` and tests into `./tests/`.

## Template Features

### Python Project Layout

The Python project structure consists of the following elements

* [`./pyproject.toml`][pyproject.toml]: Python package configuration
* `./src/`: folder that contains the Python packages and modules you want to develop
* `./test/`: folder that contains tests of your Python code

While other structures are possible, this one has proven itself (and it also the one suggested by the [Python Packaging Authority][pypa] in their [Python Packaging User Guide][] and corresponding [sample project][pypa sample project]). Modern Python packaging tools, like setuptools, will recognize this project structure without further need for configuration.

### Command Line Interface

An example command line interface is included in the `./src/cli.py` module.

### Testing and CI

Python tests are implemented using [pytest][] in the `./test/` subdirectory. Each test module starts with `test_` so it is automatically discovered when running `pytest`.

When a Gitlab remote is configured, these tests are also executed as part of a [Gitlab continuous integration][gitlab ci] pipeline, which is configured via the [`.gitlab-ci.yml`][.gitlab-ci.yml] file.

### Documentation

Each project starts with a [README][] and [CHANGELOG][] file. Additional documentation written in Markdown can be included using one of the following documentation tools:

#### Material for MkDocs

Projects generated with this option start with [MkDocs][] as a documentation system right out of the box, which is configured via the `./mkdocs.yaml` file to use the excellent [Material for MkDocs][] theme. Python docstrings are extracted and added as reference documentation using the [`mkdocstrings`][mkdocstrings] extension.

#### Sphinx

Projects generated with this option start with [Sphinx][] as a documentation system right out of the box, which is configured via the `./conf.py` file to use the excellent [Furo][] theme. [`myst`][myst] is included to add support for Markdown. Python docstrings are extracted and added as reference documentation using the [`.. automodule`][automodule] directive.

Learn more about [good documentation practices][documentation].

## Known Issues

* Do not name your project `test`. It will mess with [`pytest`'s automatic test discovery mechanism](https://docs.pytest.org/explanation/goodpractices.html#conventions-for-python-test-discovery).
